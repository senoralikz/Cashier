# Cashier
Cashier register tracking program

This program is a basic cash register tracking program. It asks for starting cash amount and then proceeds to ask how much is the bill and the payment options. If cash it adds the amount to the starting amount and if debit it asks if there is cash back and will deduct the amount if so. Gives a total amount of customers taken, cash given to register, cash given to customers, and final balance in the register.
